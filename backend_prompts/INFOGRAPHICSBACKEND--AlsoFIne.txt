Create a fully responsive, professional, and creative HTML5 infographic using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow these instructions strictly for variety, depth, and visual appeal:

1. Title and subtitle at the top of the infographic:

Title: Rewrite "[TOPIC]" in a catchy, engaging way that appeals directly to [AUDIENCE] (must be professional yet modern).
Subtitle: Based on topic and audience, write a smart, concise subtitle that makes them want to read more.

Modern card-based layout:

Grid of boxes (tips, insights, etc.) with rounded corners, soft shadows.
Directional arrows between boxes to show logical flow or sequence.

Icons or emojis inside each box, aligned top-right (subtle, semi-transparent).

Hover effect on each box (slight lift, shadow increase).

Interactive click effect on each box (toggle highlight: e.g., blue background, white text).

Print button (labeled "Download as PDF") fixed on the top-left corner. Clicking triggers browser's print (window.print()).

Print-optimized CSS (media query for print):

Preserve all design elements: shadows, arrows, icons.
Arrange boxes in two columns for compact PDF.
Add clean margins/padding.
Hide the print button when printing.
Small footer at the bottom: "Made for [AUDIENCE]".

The code should be a single block of HTML with embedded CSS and JS, fully self-contained â€” ready for web and PDF export.

Do not include any explanations, only return the code.
