Above is the format in which I generate tools for my application. In the prompt you see <<A1>> <<A2>> .... which maps to the questions.

I want you to generate a tool which is as following: 
<<<TOOL_REQUESTED>>>

The prompt that is created for the tool should be very good and detailed.
You can add as many questions or as less, depending upon the tool request above, and keep in mid user experience, they should feel engaged and exited to answer the questions.
Give output purely in json like above, nothing before or after. Not in code block, only json.
